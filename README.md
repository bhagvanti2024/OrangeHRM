This is web application. by using selenium webdriver with java automate the test script. also use TestNg framwork for execution.
 In which I used MAVEN Project It provide structure for user standard Like 
        1) src/main/java        2) src/main/resource 
        3) src/test/java        4)src/test/resource 
        5)src folder           6)target folder 
        and pom.xml file from this is src/main/java ,It maintain store my POM classes & under in src/test/java It maintain my test classes & add Maven dependencies in pom.xml file it will download automatically.
        Also use "TesNG" for execution of script with the help of its annotation.
        use selenium as automation tool.
        And also maintain utility class & Base class.
